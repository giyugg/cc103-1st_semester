# HELLO! I'm Kyle Acu√±a of BSIS 1B-G2
This is my coding journey as I learn Java through our Computer Programming subject at Bulacan State University. I will use this as my journal and archive it after my first year of studying BSIS. I also create my own personal projects here while I learn!

* Git (for commiting projects to store in Github via VSCode.)
* Github (for tracking, storing, and acting as backup of my works.)
* Github Copilot (just to assist with my code. Not actually relying on this, but it's good at predicting.)
* Java Development Kit (latest), Java Runtime Environment
* Live Server (VSC Marketplace, live preview of my HTML projects.)
* Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and Netbeans IDE<br>Note: I use VSC and IntelliJ for personal preference then Netbeans for school requirements.

## Timeline:
* August 27, 2025<br>
1. Initial commits<br>Stored all my projects that are locally saved and explored git.<br>
2. Tested Mermaid flowchart<br>
Tried flowcharting using mermaid since our lesson is related to flowchart.<br>
* September 21, 2025<br>
1. Added some files via upload.<br>
Forgot to use git and here I am, exploring git once and for all again, but used file upload instead of using terminal lol.<br>
2. Created [MemoryLeakUI.java](https://github.com/giyugg/cc103-1st_semester/blob/3d031e2b24df7e21d276165e6f44f1496996bd94/MemoryLeakUI.java) for testing purposes.<br>
I created this for RAM testing purposes and added GUI into it. **THIS IS MADE BY AI LOL PLS FORGIVE ME**<br>
* September 23, 2025<br>
1. Finished [EmployeeSalaryCalculator.java](https://github.com/giyugg/cc103-1st_semester/blob/dcdf95486a7d3c1a4fce2eeb7eb55ce793ac0a6f/EmployeeSalaryCalculator.java) and I thought it was an activity, but it wasn't lol. Also cleaned the code there on variables by decreasing line of codes :).<br>
2. Had an issue merging to main T - T<br>
Apparently, I got confused by `main` and `master`, that made 2 different branches. I resolved it without even knowing how I fixed that tho.<br>
3. I messed something up with Github Actions<br>
Atp, I don't know what I'm doing.<br>
* September 24, 2025<br>
1. I got inspired creating a calculator by [ASMR Programming](https://www.youtube.com/@AsmrProg) but I was thinking of creating a calculator app by `Java`. But it seems that creating a Java application is not on my level yet, so I decided to make it using `HTML` since I want to sharpen my learnings on `HTML`. For my current calculator project, refer to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBJmRD7kNTk) if you want to also learn. My progress can be also found [here](https://github.com/giyugg/cc103-1st_semester/tree/main/html_projects/calculator).<br>
2. Learned how to make an `issue` and `pull request` in Github. Still confused on how to do things, but I am still exploring it.<br>
3. Created this README markdown file because I thought that I can just put my journal here. Thanks for reading if you made it here lmao. I know this is very useless, but hey! Thank you ^ - ^!
